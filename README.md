Firefight is a 2.5d top-down shooter game where you play as a firefighter character with the goal to put out all the fires created by the fireball characters.

12/9/2020 v1.0.0
The current game is single player with AI enemies, the winning conditions are met when all the fires are put out or the AI enemies are eliminated.
The losing conditions are met when the fireball characters burn all the combustibles which are burnable objects in the game.
The mechanics, game modes, and assets are subject to change. We plan on continuing to work on this after the semester is over.
We will be adding more maps/levels, better art/assets, game modes including multiplayer and tweaking the mechanics as we see fit.

Map:
The v1 map is an office enviroment built in Unity ProBuilder, which allowed us to make a lot of combustibles that would be found in the real world, adding a
fun realistic feel to the game.
